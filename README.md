# Tennis-Analysis-DataSet
* ***This project was done as I was taking Junior level CS courses*** *

This project involved performing KNN and SVM on a data set chosen 

### Contents of the files:
1) data.csv: contains the data set
2) tennisRfile: contains all of the R-code for this project
3) Stats project questions and models: contains our report of our findings

### Process:
Before being able to create our code we had to clean up our data set by:
1) Filling in any missing information
2) Deleted any unnecessary variables
3) Scaling our data

After the data was completely filled I then took the necessary steps to perform both KNN and SVM on our data set

***This project was created by:***
  - Brayan Sosa(cleaning data and writing code for KNN and SVM)
  - Fatima Mirza(writing the report)
  - Fiza Gubitra(assisting with writing the report)
  - Hatem Saleh(assisting with writing the report)
